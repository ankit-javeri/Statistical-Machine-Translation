# Statistical-Machine-Translation

This is the Final semester project, **Translation of text from French to English** done in group with 3 members. 

# Description

- **Objective:** Language translation from French to English which would ease in sharing of knowledge from diverse subjects.
- **Methodology:** Understanding of lexical machine translation models such as word based translation (IBM Models for word alignments), phrase based translation (phrase extraction for phrase alignments).
- **Implementation:** Data preprocessing, handling partially missing data, implementation of IBM Model1 to learn word alignments from parallel corpus for word based machine translation.
- **Results:** Trained IBM Model1 was hardly able to learn word alignments as it was trained on only 1000 sentences (0.0526% data).
- **Improvements:** Train IBM Model1 on entire data with higher computational power & implementation of phrase based models and tree based models.
